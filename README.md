# TodoFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.12.

## Requirements

* [Node.js 18 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Setup

From the root directory (containing `package.json`) run:

```powershell
npm install
```

## Running development

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

By default, this will run in both Chrome and Firefox.
If only one of these are available, open [karma.conf.js](karma.conf.js) and remove the browser from the `browsers` array.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
